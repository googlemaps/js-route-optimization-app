# Google Fleet Routing App

**European Economic Area (EEA) developers**

If your billing address is in the European Economic Area, effective on 8 July 2025, the [Google Maps Platform EEA Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/maps-platform/eea) will apply to your use of the Services. Functionality varies by region. [Learn more.](https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/eea/faq)

A web application to explore the capabilities of [**Google Maps Platform Route Optimization**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/route-optimization) (GMPRO).

GMPRO solves vehicle routing problems (VRPs).
Given a set of *shipments* with locations,
a set of *vehicles* to carry out deliveries,
costs and additional constraints;
GMPRO works to find an optimal solution with efficient routes
where every shipment is delivered by a vehicle,
with all constraints met and minimal cost.

This application presents the properties
of the GMPRO data model as interactive forms, tables, and maps.
Users may find it a helpful way to familiarize themselves
with the data model and functions of the API.
Before writing any code, use the application to construct GMPRO scenarios,
tune constraint parameters, visualize routes, and more.

## Intended Use

The application is intended to be used as an exploratory tool
and should not be deployed in any production critical path.
Google provides this application for users to try out the API and understand
how to model their use cases in GMPRO.
But customers should implement their own solutions
to integrate Route Optimization into their business processes.

## Billing
The resources and API usage generated by the application are billed to the project owner.
*Fleet Routing App is not free to use.*
Customers can expect ongoing charges related to cloud resources
(compute, networking, storage, etc.),
along with usage-based charges for the Maps Platform APIs and Route Optimization.
When running locally for development,
the application will still incur usage-based charges for Maps and GMPRO.

In order to deploy the application to a project,
the project must be linked to a valid **Google Cloud Billing Account**.
The customer is responsible for all charges accrued on the account.

> ⚠️ The application and Route Optimization perform several kinds of batch operations.
> This means it can be easy to generate a high volume of usage in a short period of time,
> especially for large scenarios with many shipments.
> Familiarize yourself with the pricing models for Maps Platform and Route Optimization
> before using the application and routinely monitor the charges on your billing account.
>
> Keep scenarios small to begin with and get comfortable with the billing model
> before attempting to solve large scenarios which may be expensive.

### Pricing
Refer to the following pricing guides for Cloud, Maps, and GMPRO for detailed costs:
- [Google Cloud Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/pricing)
- [Google Maps Platform Pricing](https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/)

> ⚠️ Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform offer "getting started" and "free tier" credits that may cover
> a small amount of usage for free. However, as mentioned in the previous section,
> large scenarios can generate a lot of spend in a short period of time.
> If you are not careful, it is possible to use up all of your credits
> with just a few large scenarios.
