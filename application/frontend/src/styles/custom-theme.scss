// Include the common styles for Angular Material. We include this here so that you only
// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!
// TODO(v15): As of v15 mat.legacy-core no longer includes default typography styles.
//  The following line adds:
//    1. Default typography styles for all components
//    2. Styles for typography hierarchy classes (e.g. .mat-headline-1)
//  If you specify typography styles for the components you use elsewhere, you should delete this line.
//  If you don't need the default component typographies but still want the hierarchy styles,
//  you can delete this line and instead use:
//    `@include mat.legacy-typography-hierarchy($custom-typography);`
@include mat.all-legacy-component-typographies($custom-typography);
@include mat.legacy-core();

// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.
// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component
// that you are using.
@include mat.all-legacy-component-themes($dispatcher-app-theme);
